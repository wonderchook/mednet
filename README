The Kapab Medical Network is designed to provide situational awareness to all operating hospitals within Haiti, in a way that provides readiness levels, patient throughput data, and hospital needs. Authenticated users can input information into the Kapab MedNet via SMS message, telephone, email, or webpage form.

The current status of the data in the Kapab MedNet will be output to a collection of Geotagged map projects which will package critical information in easy to understand views.

The Kapab Medical Network will be fully integrated within SouthCom's All Partners Access Network (APAN) system for better visibility.
